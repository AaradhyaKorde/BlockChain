Use this as a resource if youâ€™re ever stuck with syntax errors or weird bugs in your code :)

"commit-by-lecture by breakdown" repository: https://github.com/15Dkatz/cryptochain_commits

It has an index list of a commit per lecture in this course. You may find this one more helpful as you navigate the project, and get stuck at particular sections.
